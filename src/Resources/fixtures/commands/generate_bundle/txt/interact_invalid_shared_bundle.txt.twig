Are you planning on sharing this bundle across multiple applications? [no]: 
Your application code must be written in bundles. This command helps
you generate them easily.

Each bundle is hosted under a namespace (like Acme/BlogBundle).
The namespace should begin with a "vendor" name like your company name, your
project name, or your client name, followed by one or more optional category
sub-namespaces, and it should end with the bundle name itself
(which must have Bundle as a suffix).

See http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/bundles/best_practices.html#bundle-name for more
details on bundle naming conventions.

Use / instead of \ for the namespace delimiter to avoid any problems.

Bundle namespace:  The namespace contains invalid characters. 
Bundle namespace: 
In your code, a bundle is often referenced by its name. It can be the
concatenation of all namespace parts but it's really up to you to come
up with a unique name (a good practice is to start with the vendor name).
Based on the namespace, we suggest AcmeBlogBundle.

Bundle name [AcmeBlogBundle]: 
Bundles are usually generated into the src/ directory. Unless you're
doing something custom, hit enter to keep this default!
