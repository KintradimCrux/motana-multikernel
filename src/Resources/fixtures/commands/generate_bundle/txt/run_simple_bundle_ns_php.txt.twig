Are you planning on sharing this bundle across multiple applications? [no]: 
Your application code must be written in bundles. This command helps
you generate them easily.

Give your bundle a descriptive name, like BlogBundle.
Bundle name [Run/Simple/PhpBundle]: 
In your code, a bundle is often referenced by its name. It can be the
concatenation of all namespace parts but it's really up to you to come
up with a unique name (a good practice is to start with the vendor name).
Based on the namespace, we suggest RunSimplePhpBundle.

Bundle name [RunSimplePhpBundle]: 
Bundles are usually generated into the src/ directory. Unless you're
doing something custom, hit enter to keep this default!

Target Directory [src]: 
What format do you want to use for your generated configuration?

Configuration format (annotation, yml, xml, php) [php]:
